Kimchi Project
==============

Kimchi is an HTML5 based management tool for KVM. It is designed to make it as
easy as possible to get started with KVM and create your first guest.

Kimchi runs as a daemon on the hypervisor host. It manages KVM guests through
libvirt. The management interface is accessed over the web using a browser that
supports HTML5.

Browser Support
===============
Desktop Browser Support:
-----------------------
* **Internet Explorer:** IE9+
* **Chrome:** Current-1 version
* **Firefox:** Current-1 version Firefox 24ESR
* **Safari:** Current-1 version
* **Opera:** Current-1 version

Mobile Browser Support:
-----------------------
* **Safari iOS:** Current-1 version
* **Android Browser** Current-1 version

Current-1 version denotes that we support the current stable version of the
browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current version of
a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.This does not mean that
kimchi cannot be used in other browsers, however, functionality and appearance
may be diminished and we may not be able to provide support for any problems you
find.

Hypervisor Distro Support
=========================

Kimchi daemon might run on any GNU/Linux distribution that meets the conditions
described on the 'Getting Started' section below.

The Kimchi community makes an effort to test with the latest versions of Fedora,
RHEL, OpenSuSe, and Ubuntu.

Build and Install
-----------------
    For openSUSE 13.1:
    $ ./autogen.sh --with-spice-html5

    Otherwise:
    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

Run
---

    $ sudo kimchid --host=0.0.0.0

If you cannot access Kimchi, take a look at these 2 points:

1. Firewall
Kimchi uses by default the ports 8000, 8001 and 64667. To allow incoming connections:

    For system using firewalld, do:
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8000/tcp --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8001/tcp --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=64667/tcp --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload

    For openSUSE systems, do:
    sudo /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 open EXT TCP 8000
    sudo /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 open EXT TCP 8001
    sudo /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 open EXT TCP 64667

    For system using iptables, do:
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8001 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 64667 -j ACCEPT

    Don't forget to correctly save the rules.


2. SELinux
Allow httpd_t context for Kimchi web server:

    semanage permissive -a httpd_t


Test
----

    $ make check-local # check for i18n and formatting errors
    $ sudo make check

After all tests are executed, a summary will be displayed containing any
errors/failures which might have occurred.

Usage
-----

Connect your browser to https://localhost:8001.  You should see a screen like:

![Kimchi Login Screen](/docs/kimchi-login.png)

Kimchi uses PAM to authenticate users so you can log in with the same username
and password that you would use to log in to the machine itself.  Once logged in
you will see a screen like:

![Kimchi Guest View](/docs/kimchi-guest.png)

This shows you the list of running guests including a live screenshot of
the guest session.  You can use the action buttons to shutdown the guests
or connect to the display in a new window.

To create a new guest, click on the "+" button in the upper right corner.
In Kimchi, all guest creation is done through templates.

You can view or modify templates by clicking on the Templates link in the
top navigation bar.

The template screen looks like:

![Kimchi Template View](/docs/kimchi-templates.png)

From this view, you can change the parameters of a template or create a
new template using the "+" button in the upper right corner.

To create a template, you need an ISO on your host or using remote one.
If you are willing to use your own ISO, please copy it to out of box storage
pool (default path is: /var/lib/kimchi/isos).

Known Issues
------------

1. When you are using NFS as storage pool, check the nfs export path permission
is configured as:
    (1) export path need to be squashed as kvm gid and libvirt uid:
        /my_export_path *(all_squash,anongid=<kvm-gid>, anonuid=<libvirt-uid>,rw,sync)
        So that root user can create volume with right user/group.
    (2) Chown of export path as libvirt user, group as kvm group,
        In order to make sure all mapped user can get into the mount point.
